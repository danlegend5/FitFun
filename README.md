# FitFun

FitFun is a general modelling framework for specifying and fitting models to empirical fundamental diagrams of road traffic, and for comparing the model fits using information criteria. The software implements a wide range of models within the framework. These models are built from a large selection of functional form components and various noise components with differing degrees of sophistication. All models specified within the framework can be written as Generalised Additive Models for Location, Scale, and Shape (GAMLSS).

Full details about the FitFun modelling framework can be found in our papers on the subject (see below). Documentation on the software can be found in the main script "FitFun.R" and in the individual fit modules.
